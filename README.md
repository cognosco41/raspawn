# raspawn

I destroy a raspberry pi installation on average two times per month and consequently have to go through the procedure of downloading the image, preparing a SD card, and re-configuring my pi each and every time. Raspawn is a python script that runs through this procedure programmatically thus freeing up my time for things like fishing and learning how to play the violin :)  


<b>Usage</b>: 
simply run <i><b>python raspawn.py</b></i>
